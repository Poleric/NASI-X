    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">Astronomical Unit</a></dt>
        <dd>A unit of length used primarily for measuring distances within the Solar System or secondarily between the Earth and distant stars. Originally conceived as the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the astronomical unit is now more rigidly defined as exactly 149,597,870.7 kilometres (92,956,000 miles; 4.8481×10−6 parsecs; 1.5813×10−5 light-years).</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris_disk">Debris Disk</a></dt>
        <dd>A ring-shaped circumstellar disc of dust and debris orbiting its host star. It is created by collisions between planetesimals. A debris disk can be discerned from an infrared excess being emitted from the star system, as the orbiting debris re-radiates the star's energy into space as heat.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">Escape Velocity</a></dt>
        <dd>The minimum speed that must be achieved for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body, i.e. to achieve an infinite distance from it; more generally, escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an object's kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is equal to zero. It is a function of the mass of the body and of the distance between the object and the body's center of mass. An object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface nor in a closed orbit of any radius.</dd>    
        
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_astronomy">Galactic astronomy</a></dt>
        <dd>The branch of astronomy that studies objects and phenomena within the Milky Way galaxy, as opposed to everything outside of the Milky Way, which is the domain of extragalactic astronomy.</dd>
    
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region">H II Region</a></dt>
        <dd>An ionized nebula powered by young, massive O-type stars. Ultraviolet photons from these hot stars ionize gas in the surrounding environment, and the nebular gas shines brightly in spectral lines of hydrogen and other elements. Because O-type stars have relatively short lifetimes (typically a few million years), the presence of an H II region indicates that massive star formation has taken place recently at that location. H II regions are often found in the arms of spiral galaxies and in star-forming irregular galaxies.</dd>
    
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year">Light-year</a></dt>
        <dd>A unit of length used to express astronomical distances that is equivalent to the distance that an object moving at the speed of light in vacuum would travel in one Julian year: approximately 9.46 trillion kilometres (9.46×1012 km) or 5.88 trillion miles (5.88×1012 mi). Though the light-year is often used to measure galactic-scale distances in non-specialist publications, the unit of length most commonly used in professional astrometry is the parsec.</dd>    
        
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a></dt>
        <dd>The solid, rocky body that orbits the Earth as its only natural satellite, completing a full orbit every 27.3 days. The Moon's gravitational influence is responsible for tides on Earth; because of tidal locking, only one side of the Moon is ever visible from the Earth. Sunlight reflected from its surface makes the Moon appear very bright in the night sky, though its orbital position with respect to the Earth and the Sun causes its visibility to change in a regular cycle of phases when viewed from the Earth. The adjectival lunar is often used specifically to describe the orbit, gravity, and other properties of the Earth's Moon.</dd>
    
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_galaxy">Satellite Galaxy</a></dt>
        <dd>A smaller companion galaxy that orbits within the gravitational potential of a more massive and luminous host galaxy; e.g. the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.</dd>
    
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star">Star</a></dt>
        <dd>A massive, luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity which, for at least a portion of its life, radiates energy into outer space due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within its core. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, platemperature, chemical composition, and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and its emission spectrum.</dd>    
        
        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere#Termination_shock">Termination Shock</a></dt>
        <dd>The boundary within the heliosphere, approximately 75 to 90 AU from the Sun, beyond which the solar wind slows to subsonic speeds (relative to the Sun) as a result of interactions with the local interstellar medium.</dd>   

        <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly">True Anomaly</a></dt>
        <dd>The angle between the direction of periapsis and the current position of an orbiting body as it moves along an elliptical orbit, as measured from the nearest focus of the ellipse. The true anomaly is one of three angular parameters that define a position along an orbital path, the other two being the eccentric anomaly and the mean anomaly, and also one of six canonical orbital elements used to characterize an orbit.</dd>
