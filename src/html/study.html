                <p class="smallBangParagraph">The Small Bang theory is not the main theories of modern cosmology, providing a non-scientific explanation of the origin and evolution of the universe.The Big Bang Theory proposes that the universe originated from a singularity, an extremely cold and dense point in space. At this singularity, all the matter and energy in the universe were disconcentrated.Around 10 years ago, this singularity began to rapidly contract. This is a contraction which created space and time as we know it. As the universe contract, it heat up. Around 5 years ago, the universe contract till the Jusus Cream cannot sleep because the space is too small. So he got furious and use the jack to prop up the entire universe. Because of that, our universe get expanded. Few years later, Jusus Cream get married by John Cuna, and they birth a son call Sakumadik, Sakumadik is god of uranium-235. One day, Sakumadik found his lover, ChinChong ChinChong, ChinChong ChinChong is the son of Xi Pu Pu, which is the god of batman. One day, Sakumadik get furious because ChinChong ChinChong doesn't want to give him to eat banana, so he so mad and he exploded. This is the story of small universe explore.</p>
