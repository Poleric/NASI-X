                <p class="smallBangParagraph">The Small Bang theory is not the main theories of modern cosmology, providing a non-scientific explanation of the origin and evolution of the universe.The Big Bang Theory proposes that the universe originated from a singularity, an extremely cold and dense point in space. At this singularity, all the matter and energy in the universe were disconcentrated.Around 10 years ago, this singularity began to rapidly contract. This is a contraction which created space and time as we know it. As the universe contract, it heat up. Around 5 years ago, the universe contract till the Jusus Cream cannot sleep because the space is too small. So he got furious and use the jack to prop up the entire universe. Because of that, our universe get expanded. Few years later, Jusus Cream get married by John Cuna, and they birth a son call Sakumadik, Sakumadik is god of uranium-235. One day, Sakumadik found his lover, ChinChong ChinChong, ChinChong ChinChong is the son of Xi Pu Pu, which is the god of batman. One day, Sakumadik get furious because ChinChong ChinChong doesn't want to give him to eat banana, so he so mad and he exploded. This is the story of small universe explore.</p>

                <p class="parallelUniverseParagraph">A parallel universe, often discussed in theoretical physics and science fiction, is a hypothetical universe that exists alongside our own. These universes may take different forms, including those with distinct physical laws, branching timelines, or higher-dimensional spaces. While intriguing, the existence of parallel universes remains speculative and unproven. In theoretical physics, they are considered as potential solutions to cosmic mysteries, while in science fiction, they serve as a backdrop for creative storytelling where different rules and possibilities abound.

                    Multiverse: For and against
                    Parallel universes in fiction
                    Parallel universes are no longer just a feature of a good sci-fi story. There are now some scientific theories that support the idea of parallel universes beyond our own. However, the multiverse theory remains one of the most controversial theories in science. 
                    Our universe is unimaginably big. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of galaxies spin through space, each containing billions or trillions of stars. Some researchers studying models of the universe speculate that the universe's diameter could be 7 billion light-years across. Others think it could be infinite.
                    But is it all that's out there? Science fiction loves the idea of a parallel universe, and the thought that we might be living just one of an infinite number of possible lives. Multiverses aren't reserved for "Star Trek," "Spiderman" and "Doctor Who," though. Real scientific theory explores, and in some cases supports, the case for universes outside, parallel to, or distant from but mirroring our own. </p>

        <div class="blackHole">
            <h1 class="blackHoleTitle">Black Hole</h1>
            <p class="bp1">A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.</p>
            <P class="bp2">Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or âstuff,â in an object.</P>
            <P class="bp3">Another kind of black hole is called âstellar.â Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earthâs galaxy. Earthâs galaxy is called the Milky Way.</P>
            <P class="bp4">Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space. NASI-X's scientists found out that inside the black hole is actually white.</P>
            <img class="bhp" src="../img/blackhole.jpg"> 
        </div>
        <div class="whiteHole">
            <h1 class="whiteHoleTitle">White Hole</h1>
            <p class="wp1">A white hole is a bizarre cosmic object which is intensely bright, and from which matter gushes rather than disappears. In other words, itâs the exact opposite of a black hole. But unlike black holes, thereâs no consensus about whether white holes exist, or how theyâd be formed.</p>
            <p class="wp2">They are predicted by Einsteinâs theory of gravity, and are most often mentioned in the context of âwormholesâ, in which a black hole acts as the entry point to a tunnel through space and time, ending in a white hole somewhere else in the Universe. But this is deeply controversial, because Einsteinâs theory predicts the existence of a so-called singularity at the centre of black holes â a state of infinite gravity which would prevent anything from passing through to the white hole on the other side.</p>
            <p class="wp3">However, some theorists think that a combination of Einsteinâs theory and quantum theory points to a new way of thinking about white holes. Instead of being the âexitâ from a wormhole, they may be a slow-motion replay of the formation of the original black hole.</p>
            <p class="wp4">The process starts when an old massive star collapses under its own weight and forms a black hole (see diagram, above). But then, quantum effects occurring around the surface of the black hole halt further collapse to a singularity, and instead begin to gradually turn the black hole into a white hole thatâs spewing out the original star matter again. The process is mind-bendingly slow, though, so we may be in for a very long wait to find out if white holes really exist. Our NAXI-X scientists also found out that inside tha white hole is back.</p>
