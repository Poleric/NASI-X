            <p>The forum is a place where people can interact and have discussions about different topics relevant to
                statisticians and data scientists. We ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure that the forums
                have some productive conversation. These rules and guidelines are enforced by administrators and
                moderators, and at their discretion they may delete posts without warning that do not comply. Also,
                failure to comply with these rules or our code of conduct may result in a ban from the forum.</p>
            <p>We rely on all forum members to help keep these discussion forums a safe place for people to share and
                view information. To do this, we request that all members comply with the following rules when
