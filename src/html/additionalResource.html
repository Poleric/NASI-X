                <p>During his experience studying astronomy, he proposed the <strong>heliocentric theory</strong>.</p>
                <p>This conjeture caused many people to doubt whether it was right or wrong .It took many a lot of years for other astronomers to prove that conjecture</p>

        <h1>RESEARCH PAPAERS</h1>
        <h2>Is the temperature of the sun really hot?</h2>
        <p>In people's eyes, the sun is considered hot, but we at NASI-X believe that the sun is not as simple as we think, and there are many phenomena that have not been discovered.</p>
        <p>So we sent a few astronauts to explore the real phenomena of the sun.</p>


        <p>We get the result is the sun is acutally cold</p>
        <p>Althought the reason is not yet known,the curent conjecture is that the sun will become cold when it reaches a certain temeperature </p>



        <h2>Is there life on other planets</h2>
        <p>Scientists invented earth's survival will eventually only become a burnt stone.</p>
        <p>Reason is earth rises will triggedr the escape grrenhouse effect and the earth will no longer be able to maintain even maybe explode.</p>
        <p>There are other reasons for the destruction of humans, the reduction of living organisms, and the reduction of natural energy. The more outrageous reason for suffering from the disease is that they want to eat more different delicacies.
